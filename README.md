# AlgorithmWordScramble

A Python videogame that scrambles letters where the player has to figure out the word. The main goal is to explore how decision-making principles in algorithms affect the game's design and functionality. Whilst the game is desinged for entertainment, it is still useful for the player to explore and analyse human behaviour. Puzzle functions and loops allow player to unscramble the letters in order to guess the correct word. 


To run make sure you have Python installed and from there you can also run Tkinter and Random.
